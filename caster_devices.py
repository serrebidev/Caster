"""Receiver protocols beyond Chromecast, AirPlay and plain UPnP/DLNA.

Sonos, Roku and Kodi each need their own discovery and their own way of
being told to play a URL. Kept out of caster.py so the GUI is not carrying
four protocol clients, and free of caster imports so there is no cycle.

A note on what is deliberately absent. Miracast is a Windows display
feature rather than a network protocol this app could speak; Spotify
Connect needs a Premium account and a proprietary client; Bluetooth is not
casting. DLNA already reaches most smart TVs (Samsung, LG, Sony), Xbox and
almost every AV receiver, so those are not separate integrations.
